	<h2>Who am I?</h2>

	    
   To see my picture, click the <a href="picture.html" class="button">button.</a>

	<p>My name is Tatiana Marin. I was born and raised in Moldova, South Eastern Europe.</p>
	<p>I'm very passionate about languages. I'm currently fluent in Romanian, Russian, English and I have a relatively high comprehession level in French.</p>
	<p>I recently descovered that I love computer languages as well. I tried a few things in HTML and CSS and I felt that seeing the result of my work right away is very rewarding.</p>

	<h2>What are my current goals?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>To become proficient in HTML and CSS up to the point where I could find very simple solutions to complicated chalanges</li>
		<li>Master Javascrip (and JQuery) and create fun, interactive websites</li>
		<li>Use the skills above to create an interactive English learning website for non-native speaker (open source)</li>

	</ul>

	<p><em>How Exciting!</em></p>

	<h3>What do I Follow</h3>

	<p>
		I've been following <strong>eRadu NGO</strong> activity since their opening in 2011. And that is because they are the first NGO in my home town that works with kids. They don't have a website yet, but they are working on getting one. For now they are on Facebook only.
	</p>
	<p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eradu.ngo" class="link">Here</a> you can find them on Facebook</p>	
	<p>Here are a few pictures with their latest project</p>
