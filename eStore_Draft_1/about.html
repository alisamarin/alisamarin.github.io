       		<h2>About Funkies</h2>
       			
     			<p>

     			Funkies traces its history back to a college dorm room at Stetson University where Daryle Scott got four of his college friends together to create a direct marketing company to sell cool gifts in 1982. Each person contributed $5,000 to found and create “Fun with Foo, Inc”.
          Following graduation Daryle accepted a job with IBM in Jacksonville, Florida and Fun with Foo’s first official office was the spare bedroom in Daryle’s apartment.

          </p>
          <p>
          
          Fun with Foo got off to a rapid start leading Daryle to resign from IBM in the fall of 1982 to dedicate his full efforts to the new company. Sales grew rapidly and the product line quickly expanded to include kids and holidays products.

          </p>
          <p>

          In 1999 the product offering expanded to include Tech and, as they say, the rest is history. With rapid growth in both sales and profits Daryle and the other Fun with Foo stockholders elected to sell the business. The assets of “Fun with Foo” were sold to Funkies, Inc. in July 2009. Funkies, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of bonprix.
          
          </p>
          <p>

          With the new company came a new President and CEO, Jim Brewster. <br />
          Funkies prides itself on offering quality gifts and curiosities at affordable prices and offering its customers THE very BEST customer service in the industry. Funkies is also proud that it uses US based manufacturing plants to manufacture over 90% of the products it sells.
