       			ONCE upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to the hillside to eat grass and make themselves fat. The name of each one of them was “Gruff”.

		On the way up was a bridge over a cascading stream they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.

		So first of all came the youngest Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.

		“Trip, trap! trip, trap!” went the bridge as he trotted across.

		“Who’s that tripping over my bridge?” roared the troll.

		“Oh, it is only I, the tiniest Billy Goat Gruff, and I’m going up to the hillside to make myself fat,” said the billy goat, with such a small voice.

		“Now, I’m coming to gobble you up,” said the troll.

		“Oh, no! pray don’t take me. I’m too little, that I am,” said the billy goat. “Wait a bit till the second Billy Goat Gruff comes. He’s much bigger.”

		“Well, be off with you,” said the troll.

		A little while after came the second Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.

		“TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!” went the bridge.

		“Who’s that tripping over my bridge?” roared the troll.</p>
